# The Word of God - My Divine Bible Guidance App

## Overview

This is a simple, distraction-free Flutter app designed to help you connect with God through daily Bible verses. It focuses on providing a calm and prayerful experience, allowing you to present your requests to God and receive guidance through scripture. The app uses the NRSV translation from dailyverses.net.

## Features

*   **Sign of the Cross Entry:** The app begins with a unique interactive element â€“ you draw the sign of the cross on the screen to proceed. This encourages a mindful and reverent approach.
*   **Verse Meditation:**  Presents a set of verses to meditate on before receiving a random daily verse.
*   **Random Daily Verse:**  Fetches a random verse from Bible Verse Aggregator to provide daily inspiration and guidance. This verse is intended to be relevant to your current needs and requests.
*   **Prayer Focus:** The app encourages you to calm your mind and present your requests to God before receiving the daily verse.
*   **Simple and Clean UI:**  No ads, no distracting images or videos, just the Word of God.
*   **Share Verse:** You can share to other apps.

## How it Works

1.  **Draw the Cross:** Begin by drawing the sign of the cross on the introductory screen.
2.  **Meditate:**  Reflect on a few presented verses to prepare your heart and mind.
3.  **Present Your Request:** Take a moment to silently or mentally present your needs and requests to God.
4.  **Receive Guidance:** The app will then display a random verse from the Bible, intended to offer guidance and inspiration.

## Installation (Android)

This app is currently in development and is not yet available on the Play Store.

1.  **Download the APK:** You can obtain the `.apk` file from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ysLy_f61FK8pLd33TyAN2jTpVTPuPL8K/view?usp=drive_link.
2.  **Enable Unknown Sources:**  Because the app is not from the Play Store, you'll need to enable installation from unknown sources on your Android device. This is usually found in Settings > Security (or Apps) > Unknown Sources. The exact steps may vary depending on your device. The app installation process will typically guide you through this.
3.  **Install the APK:**  Once "Unknown Sources" is enabled, tap the downloaded `.apk` file to install the app.
